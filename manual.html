<p>The most straightforward way to start is to head to the Planets menu on the bottom right corner and press the "+" button (alternatively you can press the "+" on your keyboard numpad). This will allow you add a planet with the desired properties (mass and radius) and orbital parameters. The alongside animation will show the effects of varying each parameter in turn. The planet parameters cannot be larger than those of the host star and its orbit must lie outside the stellar radius (i.e. the program will warn you if your planet crashes onto the star!).</p>
<p>Once you press the "Add" button, the animation will start showing the resulting orbit and lightcurve (bottom panel) as the planet orbits. The top panels show the system observed as an edge/face on observer (i.e. from the ecliptic plane and as viewed 90Â° from it) while the lower panel shows the relative flux (or light) received from the star as the planets orbit. You can click on any of the animation panels or press the space bar to pause the animation. Clicking or pressing the space bar again will resume them.</p>
<p>The Lightcurve menu allows to control the number of datapoints of the lightcurve (<i>N</i>) and the number of orbits for which the animation runs. The orbit is always taken to be that of the planet with the longest period. The export button allows to retrieve in comma-separated format (or comma-separated values; csv) the relative flux from the star as a function of time (i.e. the numerical values of what is being shown on the lower panel).</p>
<p>The Animation panel allows to control the speed of the animation and to download them in .webm format. The more frames per millisecond, the slower the animation will run. It will also take longer to download. Adjust <i>N</i>, the number of orbits and the frame rate to ensure the animation looks sensible before downloading it.</p>
<p>Finally one last tip: if all you are after is a beautiful demonstration of how a planetary transit occurs, then aim for abnormally (and even unrealistic) planets and very short periods, as that's going to give you the most visually appealing animation.</p>
<p>That's all, enjoy!</p>
