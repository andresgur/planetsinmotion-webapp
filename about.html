<p>This application allows you to build your custom planetary system in order to evaluate the amount of light they would eclipse from the host star as they transit in front of it.</p>
<p> The program calculates the eclipsing area of all planets as a function of time, accounting for the eclipses between planets as well. The top panels show the system observed as an edge/face on observer (i.e. from the ecliptic plane and as viewed 90Â° from it) while the lower panel shows the light received from the star as the planets orbit. The shadows of the planets however do not consider the eclipses induced by the other planets. </p>
<p> The equations employed do not account for the gravitational pull of the various planets, only from the host star. As such, the calculations are valid in the M<sub>ð“‡³</sub>>>M<sub>planet</sub>. If this condition is not satisfied then the program is less accurate. As such, the application is intended mostly for illustrative/educational purposes. Moreover, despite the star being limb-darkened for visualization purposes, this is also not accounted in the generated lightcurve.</p>
<p> The idea occured to me during a trip as teaching staff to the Observatorio del Teide in Tenerife, Spain, where some of the student from the University of Southampton carried out observations of exoplanet transits. We decided to work out analytically the area covered by a planet during a transit for an arbitrary orbit and I quickly built a prototype in python. The rest is history.</p>
